# Bitcoin Native DAO Smart Contract

## Overview

This smart contract implements a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) specifically designed for Bitcoin holders, enabling advanced governance, voting, staking, and treasury management functionalities.

## Features

### Key Functionalities

- **Staking**: Users can stake their Bitcoin tokens
- **Proposal Creation**: Stakeholders can create governance proposals
- **Voting**: Stake-weighted voting system
- **Treasury Management**: Execute proposals that transfer funds
- **Flexible Governance**: Configurable parameters like minimum stake, quorum, and voting periods

### Unique Characteristics

- Minimum stake requirement
- Stake-based voting power
- Whitelisted recipient management
- Proposal lifecycle management

## Contract Components

### Constants

- `contract-owner`: The initial deployer of the contract
- Various error codes for different scenarios

### Data Variables

- `minimum-stake`: Minimum amount required for staking (default: 1 BTC)
- `proposal-count`: Tracks total number of proposals
- `quorum-percentage`: Percentage of votes required to pass a proposal (default: 51%)
- `voting-period`: Duration of voting period (default: ~1 day in Bitcoin blocks)

### Main Functions

#### Staking

- `stake(amount)`: Stake Bitcoin tokens
  - Requires minimum stake amount
  - Locks tokens for ~2 weeks
- `unstake(amount)`: Withdraw staked tokens
  - Only after lock period expires

#### Proposal Management

- `create-proposal(title, description, amount, recipient)`:
  - Create a new governance proposal
  - Requires minimum stake
  - Validates recipient address
- `vote(proposal-id, vote-bool)`:
  - Cast a vote on an active proposal
  - Voting power based on staked amount
- `execute-proposal(proposal-id)`:
  - Execute proposal after voting period
  - Checks quorum requirements
  - Transfers funds if proposal passes

#### Admin Functions

- `update-minimum-stake(new-minimum)`
- `update-quorum-percentage(new-percentage)`
- `update-voting-period(new-period)`
- `set-whitelisted-recipient(recipient, status)`

## Security Measures

- Owner-only administrative functions
- Stake-based proposal creation
- Whitelisted recipient validation
- Locked staking periods
- Quorum-based proposal execution
- Multiple validation checks

## Error Handling

Comprehensive error codes covering scenarios like:

- Insufficient balance
- Invalid proposals
- Voting restrictions
- Unauthorized actions

## Usage Example

```clarity
;; Stake tokens
(contract-call? .bitcoin-dao stake u1000000)

;; Create a proposal
(contract-call? .bitcoin-dao create-proposal
    "Fund Community Project"
    "Proposal to fund blockchain education"
    u500000
    'ST2CY5V39MWKFS1R8MYXZ1Q5A9VQ26H9K4KENR3V)

;; Vote on a proposal
(contract-call? .bitcoin-dao vote u1 true)
```

## Deployment Requirements

1. Stacks blockchain environment
2. Minimum of 1 BTC equivalent for initial deployment
3. Owner account for administrative functions

## Configuration

Initial configuration can be set during contract initialization:

- Minimum stake amount
- Quorum percentage
- Voting period duration

## Limitations and Considerations

- Voting power directly correlates with staked amount
- Proposals require a minimum stake to create
- Funds are transferred in STX, not native Bitcoin
- Whitelisted recipient mechanism for additional security

## Recommended Improvements

- Implement more granular voting mechanisms
- Add time-locked governance tokens
- Develop more complex proposal types
- Enhance recipient validation
