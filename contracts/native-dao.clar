;; title: Bitcoin Native DAO Smart Contract
;; summary: A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for Bitcoin holders, enabling governance, voting, staking, and treasury management.
;; description: This smart contract implements a comprehensive DAO for Bitcoin holders. It allows users to stake their Bitcoin, create and vote on proposals, and manage a treasury. The contract includes functionalities for proposal creation, voting, staking, and executing proposals based on quorum requirements. It also provides administrative functions to update key parameters such as minimum stake, quorum percentage, and voting period.
